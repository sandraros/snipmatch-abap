Code recommenders are not maintained anymore and have been archived in July, 2019
(https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=1099870&goto=1809881&#msg_1809881)

- Workaround: install new software from https://repo.eclipse.org/content/shadows/releases.unzip/org/eclipse/recommenders/stable/2.5.4/stable-2.5.4.zip-unzip/
(it worked with Eclipse 2019-06)
